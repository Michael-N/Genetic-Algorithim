- Description: a small library for a genetic algorithm... this is the seccond version of the code after I took more time to think as to how it could be implemented
## About:
- an implememtation of a genetic algorithm; the library code is designed to be used for any specific problem however a string search is implemented here
- the program currently is given a target string for which the fitness function is tailored to provide hints in the form of a fitness value
- this was just a side project to learn more about genetic algorithms...
- also there are some ideas... and realizations I made while messing around with the parameters of the algorithm... 

## Examples
- ```example_G.py``` was run on the target '*make it so commander data said piccard*' (without spaces) 
![exampleGARunning](exampleGA.gif)
- The genome space was all possible letters of the alphabet; 
- The mutation function would simply ofset the character from its order in the alphabet: i.e the letter **a** would be given a random offset ... so for example an offset of 12 would yield the letter **m**
- Genetic algorithms are very good at performing acceptably in many domains across computer science given the right fitness and mutation functions are determined.

- Description: this file was a first attempt at a genetic algorithm without optimization...
- An example of a String Finder GA for this code is in file ```example_GA.py```
### function:   ```weighted_choice```

- **prop**:   ```self.mostFitOfAllTime ``` defaults to 0  in the form of a fake instance of individual class (an individual with an empty genome)
                                ... stores a copy of the most fit individual of all the generations... 
- **prop**:   ```self.populationTotalFitness```  defaults to none ... stores the population total fitness so it is not recalculated a bunch of times..
                                     NOTE! this is calculated by the function evalFitnessPopulaton...
- **prop**:   ```self.mutationProbability```     is the probability that an individual gene in an individual will mutate...
#### method ```main```:   
- runs the genetic algorithm passes the most fit after each generation to the logger func  and returns the most fit when finished
- **param**   ```stopFunc```: Must SPECIFY a function that is passed the most fit individual... then returns true to stop or false to exit
- **param**   ```generations``` =100 by default... number of generations to compute 
- **param**   ```logFunc```= a function that logs ... is passed data... defaults to printing the data
                 in the form : ```python
                 {"mostFit":self.mostFitOfAllTime,"generationsComputed":currentGen+1}
                 ```
#### constructor:   
- initilizes a genetic algorithm
- **param**   ```fitFunc```  = a function that takes a genome list and returns a (numeric) value representing its fitness
- **param**   ```randGeneFunc``` = a function that generates a random VALUE which is the gene for a genome...

- **param**   ```p``` = population size int default 10   
- **param**   ```g``` = genome size int default 2
- **param**   ```mutationProb``` = the probability of mutating any one gene in an individual when mutation is computed... ex 5 for 5% also defaults to 5
#### method ```genInitialPop```:  
- generates the initial populaton
####method ```evalFitnessPop```:    
- evaluates the fitness of the entire population and SETS each child's probability of Selection NOTE! calculates populationTotalFitness... 
- **param**    ```fitFunc``` = a function that takes a genome list and returns a (normalized) value representing its fitness
####method ```selectTwoFromPop```: 
- select two individuals from population based on their probability of selection: Universal stochastic selection... 
- returns a tuple of the two selected
####method ```mutatePop```:   
- mutates the population.... (on a gene by gene basis) prob of mutation set as ```self.mutationProbability```
###class Individual
- **prop**:   ```self.genome``` stores the genome of the individual
- **prop**:   ```self.fitness``` default None stores the fitness of an individual MUST be a positive numeric value
- **prop**:   ```self.probOfSelection``` default none is set after fitness values ... 
#### constructor:

- **param**   ```otherIndividual``` = (instance of Individual class) number of crossover points is 1
#### method ```mutate```: 
- **param**   ```mutationFunc``` = a function that takes a gene as an argument and returnes the mutated gene; WARN defaults to identity function i.e. NO mutation
- **param** ```prob``` = double num default 5%; ex. prob=5 for 5%; is the probability of mutating an individual gene...
- **method** ```evalFitness```:    
- **param**    ```fitFunc``` = a function that takes a genome list and returns a (normalized) value representing its fitness
