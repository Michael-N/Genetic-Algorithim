- Description: a small library for a genetic algorithm... this is the seccond version of the code after I took more time to think as to how it could be implemented
## About:
- an implememtation of a genetic algorithm; the library code is designed to be used for any specific problem however a string search is implemented here
- the program currently is given a target string for which the fitness function is tailored to provide hints in the form of a fitness value
- this was just a side project to learn more about genetic algorithms...
- also there are some ideas... and realizations I made while messing around with the parameters of the algorithm... 
## TODO:
- convert inline documentation into a readme... and standardize conventions
- provide use case example
